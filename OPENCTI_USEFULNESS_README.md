def check_siem_alerts():
    alerts = get_siem_alerts()  # Your SIEM integration
    for alert in alerts:
        reputation = demo.check_ioc_reputation(alert['ioc'], alert['type'])
        if reputation['is_malicious']:
            escalate_alert(alert, reputation)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify your API token is correct
2. **Connection Issues**: Ensure OpenCTI is running and accessible

### Debug Mode
Add debug output to scripts:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Manual Cleanup
If demo data isn't cleaned up automatically:
```bash
# Access OpenCTI web interface
# Go to Data ‚Üí Entities
# Filter by creation date and delete demo entities
```

The demonstrations track various metrics:
- **Entity Creation Speed**: Time to create threat entities
- **Query Performance**: Response times for searches
- **Relationship Mapping**: Time to establish connections
