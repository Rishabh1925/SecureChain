   - Demonstrated vulnerability analysis capabilities
   - Provided remediation guidance
   - Tested contextual query handling

### 🎯 Real Threat Scenarios Tested

1. **Web-to-Database Lateral Movement**
   - Entry: Log4j RCE (CVE-2021-44228)
   - Path: Web Server → Database Server
   - Impact: Data exfiltration

2. **FTP Backdoor Exploitation**
   - Entry: vsftpd backdoor (CVE-2011-2523)
   - Path: FTP → SMB → Network propagation
   - Impact: System compromise

3. **RDP Admin Access**
   - Entry: BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)
   - Path: Direct admin workstation access
   - Impact: Domain compromise

### 📊 Key Metrics Achieved

- **Network Assets Mapped:** 5 systems across 3 zones
- **Risk Score Range:** 0.76 - 0.95 (High to Critical)
- **Test Success Rate:** 80% (4/5 components operational)

### 🛠️ Generated Artifacts

**Visualizations:**
- Advanced attack graph (PNG/HTML)
- Network topology diagrams
- Risk assessment charts

**Data Files:**
- Realistic vulnerability datasets
- Attack path analysis (CSV)
