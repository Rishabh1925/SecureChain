## 🎭 Chatbot Interaction Examples

### Real Chatbot Session:
```
🔍 Your question: how can attacker attack on my site?

🤖 🕸️ POTENTIAL ATTACK PATHS

🔴 HIGH-RISK ATTACK PATH:
1. Initial Access: Exploit web application vulnerabilities (HTTP/HTTPS services)
2. Code Execution: Leverage critical vulnerabilities like Log4j for remote code execution
3. Persistence: Establish foothold on the compromised system
4. Lateral Movement: Use system access to explore internal network
5. Data Exfiltration: Access sensitive data or systems

🛡️ DEFENSIVE MEASURES:
• Patch critical vulnerabilities immediately
• Implement network segmentation
• Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR)
```

```
